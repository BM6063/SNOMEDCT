This is R code (quatro markdown) to use the R package Rdiagnosislist to query SNOMED-CT.
The file provides a few example codes. 
See if you can get this to work to search for breast cancer SNOMED-CT codes


If you do not wish to use, R.  You can develop similar code in python Libraries and resources include

A Python equivalent for working with SNOMED CT similar to the R repository you have (https://github.com/BM6063/SNOMEDCT) can be built using libraries such as PyMedTermino or Pathling:

**1. PyMedTermino**
Offers Python bindings to access SNOMED CT concepts, relationships, and ontological queries.
Allows you to load SNOMED CT ontologies and search concepts by code or description.
Supports accessing synonyms, parents, children, and associated clinical findings.

Example snippet:

python
from pymedtermino.snomedct import *

# Load SNOMED CT ontology
SNOMEDCT.load()

# Get concept by code (e.g., breast cancer)
concept = SNOMEDCT[254837009]
print(concept)
print(concept.definition)
print(concept.parents)
Documentation: https://pythonhosted.org/PyMedTermino/

**2. Pathling (Python API)**
Library to analyze and group SNOMED CT concepts with a terminology server backend.
Works with Spark for scalable data pipelines.
Allows you to query value sets, explore hierarchies, and display SNOMED terms.

Example snippet:

python
from pathling import PathlingContext

pc = PathlingContext.create()
df = pc.spark.read.csv("snomed_data.csv", header=True)
df = df.withColumn("Snomed Term", pc.snomed.display("concept_column"))
df.show()

**3. Using REST APIs like Snowstorm**
Snowstorm API offers RESTful services to query SNOMED concepts, relationships, and maps.
You can use Python libraries like requests to query and retrieve SNOMED data.

Example snippet:

python
import requests

url = "https://snowstorm.example.com/fhir/CodeSystem/$lookup?code=254837009"
response = requests.get(url)
print(response.json())
