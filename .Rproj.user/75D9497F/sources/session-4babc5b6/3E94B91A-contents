# Exercise: Exploring SNOMED CT for Breast Cancer Research Using Rdiagnosislist

## Real-World Context

In cancer bioinformatics and clinical research, accurately identifying patients with breast cancer diagnoses and related procedures from electronic health records requires robust use of SNOMED CT coding. This facilitates cohort selection, outcome tracking, and integration of clinical data across coding systems like ICD-10.

## Objectives

-   Load SNOMED CT dictionaries for analysis
-   Search for breast cancer-related clinical concepts
-   Generate a comprehensive SNOMED CT codelist including subtypes and related clinical findings
-   Map SNOMED CT breast cancer codes to ICD-10 codes for interoperability
-   Summarize and inspect the final coding list for use in research cohorts

## Setup

Install and load package

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("Rdiagnosislist", quietly = TRUE)) 
{ 
  install.packages("Rdiagnosislist") 
   install.packages("data.table") 
  } 

library(Rdiagnosislist) 
library(data.table)


```

## Load (sample) SNOMED CT dictionary environment

To query SNOMED, you need a copy of the dictionary

You may need to register.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load UK and International SNOMED CT release files into R
# Load UK and International SNOMED CT release files into an
# R environment called 'SNOMED'

SNOMED <- loadSNOMED(c(
  'SnomedCT_InternationalRF2_PRODUCTION_20200731T120000Z/',
  'SnomedCT_UKClinicalRF2_PRODUCTION_20210317T000001Z/'))

# Save the 'SNOMED' environment to a file on disk
saveRDS(SNOMED, file = 'mySNOMED.RDS')

# Reload the 'SNOMED' environment from file
SNOMED <- readRDS('mySNOMED.RDS')
```

## Example Code 

### 1. Identify Breast Cancer Concepts in SNOMED CT

Search for SNOMED CT concepts matching. I am just using the sample SNOMED library here. This is miminal and only includes heart info

```{r}
SNOMED<- sampleSNOMED()
bc_concepts<- SNOMEDconcept('Heart failure', SNOMED = SNOMED)
```

With the full library I should be able to search for cancer related terms eg

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bc_concepts <- SNOMEDconcept('breast cancer', SNOMED=SNOMED)
print(bc_concepts)
```

### 2. Create a SNOMED CT Codelist Including Descendant Concepts

Include closely related concepts

```{r}
bc_codelist <- SNOMEDcodelist(bc_concepts, include_desc=TRUE, SNOMED=SNOMED)
print(bc_codelist)
```

### 3. Map Breast Cancer SNOMED Codes to ICD-10

Map the breast cancer SNOMED codes to ICD-10 codes to enable cross-system use

```{r}
bc_icd10_map <- getMaps(bc_codelist, to='icd10', SNOMED=SNOMED)
print(bc_icd10_map)
```

### 4. Extract Unique ICD-10 Codes and Labels

Create a summary table of unique ICD-10 codes for breast cancer-related diagnoses

```{r}
bc_icd10_codes <- data.table(code = unique(bc_icd10_map$code), term = unique(bc_icd10_map$term))
print(bc_icd10_codes)
```


## Question

Women who have hormone (estrogen receptor) positive breast cancer often recieve endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor).

-   [Tamoxifen](https://evsexplore.semantics.cancer.gov/evsexplore/concept/ncit/C62078) is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that blocks estrogen receptors on cancer cells. It is used primarily in pre-menopausal women and also sometimes in post-menopausal cases.

-   Aromatase inhibitors (e.g., anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) prevent production of estrogen by blocking the aromatase enzyme; these are mainly used in post-menopausal women.

<!-- -->

-   Menopausal status is often approximated using age 55 as a surrogate cutoff in clinical and research settings.

For this exercise we will try to define a cohort of women with breast cancer who might be eligible for [Tamoxifen](https://evsexplore.semantics.cancer.gov/evsexplore/concept/ncit/C62078). You will develop code to identify the SNOMED-CT that might be useful.

1.  Find codes for breast cancer
2.  Find codes for this cohort of hormone positive breast cancer

Whilst the above provides and example with Rdiagnosislist, may need to explore other R packages for SNOMED-CT eg snomedizer (R interface to the SNOMED CT Terminology Server REST API) or https://github.com/ropensci/trud. (Inferface to NHS TRUD API to programmatically download SNOMED and other NHS reference data directly from the server.)

## Deliverables

-   Submit your completed R script implementing all code steps with comments.

-   Provide the data table containing breast cancer-related ICD-10 codes and descriptions derived from SNOMED CT mappings.

## Reflection

-   Why is precise terminology mapping crucial when defining cancer cohorts?

-   What challenges might arise from incomplete or ambiguous mappings?
